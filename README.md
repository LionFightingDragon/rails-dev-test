# Simple RoR test for candidates

This repository contains basic Rails 5 application that can be developed by candidates applying to goodylabs

# Getting started

1. `bundle install`
2. `rake db:create`

# The goal

The goal of the exercise is to create a checkout system that fulfills the criteria listed below:
1. Products can be added to a basket
2. Products can be removed from a basket
3. Basket can be checked out - a total price is calculated
4. Customerâ€™s Email, Address and Credit card details are required to check out
5. Customers will have an Order after checking out that contains all the basket items

8. Products can be bought more than once
    
# Deliverables :
- Create a database that can support the criteria
- Create pages to accommodate functionality
- Validation of intended functionality
- Brief written summary of approach, assumptions, caveats and notes
- Instructions on how to run the project
- Submission should be a GitHub repository
- RSpec tests 
 
 Note:
